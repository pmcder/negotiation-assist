#Project Description

I made this project for my software design patterns class as an example of the memento pattern.

This project is an application to assist the user in haggling. It helps buyers buy low and sellers sell high. It is useful for yard sales, real estate, insurance, business, and even government. This release is optimized for an insurance claims negotiation. 


The use case of memento pattern here is the undo feature in the console based user interface. The application promts the user to chose a role: either buyer or seller. If the user is the seller they must enter a starting price. The user is then prompted to enter the other party's counter offer amount and suggests what the user's optimal next counter amount should be. After each exchange, the user can press "u" to undo and application will undo the last exchange.

My primary design goal was to create a way for a user to perform an undo action. I have achieved that goal through the memento pattern. Another goal is flexibility. Memento pattern also supports that goal as the memento and care taker classes could be used with a GUI or other client code. In this release the client code is the main class which contains the console user interface logic.


# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run

```bash
mvn -q clean compile exec:java -Dexec.executable="edu.bu.met.cs665.Main" -Dlog4j.configuration="file:log4j.properties"
```

We recommand the above command for running the project. 

Alternativly, you can run the following command. It will generate a single jar file with all of the dependencies. 

```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single

java -Dlog4j.configuration=file:log4j.properties -classpath ./target/JavaProjectTemplate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar  edu.bu.met.cs665.Main
```


# Run all the unit test classes.


```bash
mvn clean compile test

```

# Using Findbugs 

To see bug detail using the Findbugs GUI, use the following command "mvn findbugs:gui"

Or you can create a XML report by using  


```bash
mvn findbugs:gui 
```

or 


```bash
mvn findbugs:findbugs
```


For more info about FindBugs see 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/

And about Maven Findbug plugin see 
https://gleclaire.github.io/findbugs-maven-plugin/index.html


You can install Findbugs Eclipse Plugin 

http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/eclipse.html



SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


# Run Checkstyle 

CheckStyle code styling configuration files are in config/ directory. Maven checkstyle plugin is set to use google code style. 
You can change it to other styles like sun checkstyle. 

To analyze this example using CheckStyle run 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

This will generate a report in XML format


```bash
target/checkstyle-checker.xml
target/checkstyle-result.xml
```

and the following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open it using a Web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

```bash
target/site/checkstyle.html
```


# Generate  coveralls:report 

```bash
mvn -DrepoToken=YOUR-REPO-TOCKEN-ON-COVERALLS  cobertura:cobertura coveralls:report
```
